I noticed the original meeting minutes (First Meeting and Second Meeting) were as non-editable text files. So these are all the meeting minutes and agendas as text files. The uploaded dates of the PDFs are the days they were written, as I uploaded them straight after they were created. Therefore our meetings were at the same time and day each week.
Since the week of the Third Meeting, all the meeting minutes and agendas have been uploaded as editable text files, straight after they were created.
